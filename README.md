# FUTURE_ML_02: Churn Prediction System

🎯 **Objective:**  
Predict which customers are likely to churn using machine learning.

📁 **Dataset:** Telco Customer Churn Dataset (Kaggle)

🧰 **Tools Used:**  
- Python  
- Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib  
- Scikit-learn, Random Forest  
- Google Colab

📊 **Key Steps:**  
- Data cleaning (`TotalCharges`, NaNs)  
- Label + One-hot encoding for categorical features  
- Model training using Random Forest  
- Evaluation (accuracy, confusion matrix)  
- Beautiful visualizations (tenure, gender, charges vs churn)

📈 **Results:**  
- Predictive model with ~85% accuracy  
- Identified key churn factors  
- Graphs for churn distribution, feature importance, and more
